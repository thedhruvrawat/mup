## Lab 5: DOS Interrupts â€“ Basic Keyboard & Display Console Interrupts (continued)

### Task

Write an ALP that does the following 

1. Displays **"enter your name without any space"**
2. Takes in your name without any space and compares with your name alteady stored in memory. [this serves as the `username`]
3. If there is *no match* it should **exit**
4. If there is a *match*, it asks for password saying **"Kindly enter your password"**. The password while being typed by the user should be echoed, but a `*` should be displayed for every character typed by the user (so as to maintain confidentiality, and that person seeing screen can't get to know). KEEP PASSWORD AS your `idnumber`. 
5. If the password is *wrong*, it should display **"wrong password"** and should **exit**
6. If password *matches*, it should display **"Authentication Successful, you are welcome"** followed by your `username`

Your submission should be in the form of `zip` and having 
- Your code 
- A snapshot of your DOSBox screen showing `username`, `password (****...)` and `"Autehntication..... "` message as given in the question.
